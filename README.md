# Uncommon R Bugs: Recycling and Empty Subsets

This repository demonstrates two uncommon but potentially problematic scenarios in R programming:

1. **Implicit Recycling:** R's automatic recycling of vectors in arithmetic operations can lead to unexpected results if not handled carefully.
2. **Empty Subsets:**  Errors can arise when subsetting data frames and the resulting subset is empty.  Robust code needs to account for this possibility.

The `bug.R` file contains examples showcasing these issues. The `bugSolution.R` demonstrates how to improve the code to prevent or handle these situations.
